            <h2>What is Shadow Work?</h2>
            <p>
                Maybe you've seen the hundreds of ads pushing Shadow Work journals on TikTok, but it's more than just a trend. Shadow Work acknowledges the unconscious and repressed dark side in all of us. Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds. What's really terrifying is ignoring your feelings instead of bringing them into the light.
            </p>
            <p>
                By accepting even the darkest parts of ourselves, we can live calmer, more balanced lives. We abandon toxic ideals and embrace the messiness of living. We can better relate with the flaws in others instead of judging them.
            </p>

            <h2>How does InspoTarot work?</h2>
            <p>
                <em>So how does this web app work?</em> To help explain it, think of your thoughts as an iceberg. There are a few prominent thoughts sticking out above the water, yet below sits a massive bulk of ideas and memories we can't, or don't want, to see.

            <p>
                InspoTarot presents users with random Tarot cards and asks them to identify words they can relate to, if any. After selecting a few words from five cards, these cards are analyzed to see how the conscious word choices connect to other meanings attached to that card, as well as the others in the spread. At the end the user receives a summary of the conscious and unconscious patterns across all five cards. Users can also enter questions to get more specific readings.
